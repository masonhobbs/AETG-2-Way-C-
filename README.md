# AETG-2-Way-C++

C++ implementation of the AETG algorithm to study and analyze combinatorial testing for software. 
Uses two dimensional matrices for creating combination pairs representing factors such as hardware, operating system, and memory size. 
Produces test suites to cover all possible pairs that are around the ideal size in the original AETG algorithm publication. 
Achieved the fastest execution time in the class.
